    // Exercise #1: 

    // Write a function that will change the src property of the img tag in this document to a picture of a cat when the button is pressed. You want to receive the response in the format of 'src', so pay attention to the Cat API documentation. You will need XMLHttpRequest(); for this.


    // Hint: Be careful where in your code you change the src property - or else you might not get the results you expect.

    // Exercise #2:

    // Take a look at the documentation (http://thecatapi.com/docs.html) and write a loop that puts every category available in an unordered HTML list. Each category should be it's own list item. You can put this list underneath the button and img from the first exercise. 


    // Exercise #3:

    // Now, create a new button and img tag with unique IDs underneath the existing your list of categories. This time, change the URL parameters/arguments so that you get a cat from a different category.

    // Bonus Exercise:

    // For each cat, put the cat photo into the page with the category and the URL used for the request underneath it
