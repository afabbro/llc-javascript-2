    <!-- SLIDE: FUNCTIONS SUMMARY -->
    <article class='slide slide-list'>
      <h2>Review: What do we know about Functions so far?</h2>
      <br />
      <p><strong>&rsaquo;</strong> Created &amp; defined by using the <code>function</code> keyword</p>
      <p><strong>&rsaquo;</strong> Used to group together related lines of code and store them under descriptive names</p>
      <p><strong>&rsaquo;</strong> Can be reused just by calling the function name</p>
      <p><strong>&rsaquo;</strong> <strong>Define</strong> the function first but it will not run until you <strong>call</strong> the function</p>
      <p><strong>&rsaquo;</strong> Can be used inside another function</p>
    </article>

    <article class='slide slide-list'>
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>Most of our code will run as a result of functions</p>
      <p>Functions and how the browser deals with them: in Angelina's opinion, the most important thing to learn early!</p>

      <h2>Exercise #1: Review Skills from JS I (10 mins)</h2>
      <p>Take a look at index.html in the /review/ folder</p>
      <p>Don't be shy to ask your new friends or your mentor</p>
      <p>Have helpers.html open in a tab for reference</p>

      <h2>Quick Synonyms</h2>
      <p>Programming, like any field, has it's own jargon. There are some words that you will encounter that mean the same thing</p>
      <p>Call a function: execute, run, invoke</p>
      <p>Function parameter: argument</p>
    </article>

    <!-- SCOPE AND FUNCTIONS -->
    <article>
      <h2>Revisiting Scope</h2>
      <p>Javascript has function level scope</p>
      <p>This means that function declarations define the boundaries of what variables and functions are available for other code to interact with</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <p>Run some examples to demonstrate things being in and out of scope</p>

      <h2>JavaScript is asynchronous</h2>
    </article>
    <article class='slide slide-list'>
      <h2>Synchronous Programming</h2>
      <p>Imagine that you need groceries. You go out of your home to buy some.</p>
      <p>You go to a butcher, and after finding some good meat you pay at the cash register.</p>
      <p>Next, you go to the produce shop and pick out some vegetables. Then, you pay at the cash register.</p>
      <p>Finally, you decide to drop into a specialty cheese shop for some brie on your way home. You pay at the cash register, and then you take all of your purchases home.</p>
    </article>

    <article class='slide slide-list'>
      <h2>Asynchronous Programming</h2>
      <p>Imagine that you need groceries. Unlike our first example, in this one you stay home and shop online.</p>
      <p>You shop at a grocer that offers fresh produce delivered to your door. You pick some, check out, and then pay.</p>
      <p>Then, you locate a vendor that sources locally produced meats. You buy some bacon and steak at a good price and then pay at the checkout.</p>
      <p>You decide to order a special treat from an online candy shop. You pay at the checkout.</p>
      <p>Unlike the first example, you have to wait for all of your packages to arrive. You don't know when they will arrive, you just know it will be sometime in the future.</p>
      <p>You don't know what order things will arrive in.</p>

    <!-- THE BROWSER EVENT LOOP -->

    <article class='slide slide-list'>
      <h2>So.. How Does This Javascript Stuff Work Anyways?</h2>
      <p>Seriously, it's all invisible to us.</p>
      <p>... what is going on inside the browser when functions are called?</p>
      <p>A lot of Javascript developers don't know this!<p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>The Browser Event Loop</h2>
      <p> aka 'what the Javascript is doing behind the scenes'
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Questions to Ask</h2>
      <p>What happens if the browser has to deal with more than one event?</p>
      <p>How does it keep track of them?</p>
      <p>What if other code is running - other functions are running - and an event happens?</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Stacks and Queues</h2>
      <p>Stacks and queues are two data structures that you will hear about often when programming.</p>
      <p>A data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data/information. Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks.</p>
      <p>You can think of a stack or a queue as an object that stores other objects, but with conditions on how the objects can be stored and accessed.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Stacks</h2>
      <p>A stack is like a box with a bottom</p>
      <p>Whatever object is stored last in the stack is on top</p>
      <p>We can't get at anything else in the stack other than the object on top</p>
      <p>Stacks are said to be LIFO: Last In, First Out</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Queues</h2>
      <p>A queue is just like a line-up at the bank<p>
      <p>Objects can only enter the queue at the end of the line, behind all the other objects.</p>
      <p>Queues are said to be FIFO: First In, First Out</p>

    <!-- CALLBACKS -->

    <article>
      <h2>Callbacks</h2>
      <p>You need to use callback function when you need to execute something just after the function you called.</p>
      <p>The callback is a function that is called when your asynchronous code is done running.</p>
      <p>"Hey Javascript, I don't know when this code will run, but when it does you need to make sure you do this step/run this function right after."</p>
      <p>Callback functions are given as arguments - remember functions are objects that we can pass into other functions!</p>
    </article>

    <article><h2>Some Advice On Callbacks</h2>
      <h3>"Callbacks are just like children: they make you happiest when you give them names and plenty of room" - @maxogden</h3>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Don't Inline Functions</h2>
      <p>Some people do, but it can get messy</p>
      <p> [Example of inlining vs. not inlining]</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Name Your Callbacks</h2>
      <p>It makes figuring out where your code went wrong easier.</p>

      <h2>Closures: The magic one-way mirror</h2>
      <p>When you pass along a function, you not only get what is inside the function... but also the parent function!</p>
      <p>This scope also gets passed along with a function when the function is passed around.</p>
      <p>You already know this and you're already using closures, I just wanted you to know there is a name for this in case you see closures around the internet</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Closures and Function Scope: Like a One-Way Mirror/Glass</h2>
      <p>The inner function can 'see' the contents of the outer function, but the outer function cannot see the contents of the inner function</p>
      <small>Thanks to <a href='http://twitter.com/supersole'>@supersole</a> for this tidy analogy.</small>

    <article>
      <h2>Using Callbacks to Handle Network Requests</h2>
      <p>Let's learn how to talk to someone else's code remotely</p>
      <p>We can talk to someone else's program using an API</p>
      <p>We can get data (images, text, etc.) to use in our own app!</p>
    </article>

    <!-- APIs and NETWORK REQUESTS -->
    <article>
      <h2>APIs: What Are They?</h2>
      <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface</p>
      <p>A set of functions for remotely accessing data/content</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>How do we know if an application has an API?</h2>
      <p>There will be a link on their homepage (e.g. Facebook, Twitter)</p>
      <p>You want to read the documentation first!</p>
      <p>A cursory web search will help you find useful APIs</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>What is a Network Request?</h2>
      <p>A network request is a function that uses the browser's ability to fetch from a URL/web location to get data without having to load it in HTML</p>
      <p>We use XMLHttpRequest(); - a function built in to your browser</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <p>You use a function to create a request object, open a URL, and then use a method to send the request.  The HTTP status of the result, as well as the result's contents, are available in the request object when the transaction is completed.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Let's request... some cats!</h2>
      <p>We are going to use the API for http://thecatapi.com/</p>
      <p>Head to this link and find the documentation.</p>

    <!-- HOW TO USE THIRD PARTY CODE -->

    <article class='slide slide-list'>
      <h2>Using Someone Else's Code</h2>
      <p>How do you know how to use it?</p>
      <p>How do you know if it's safe?</p>
      <p>Where do you get it?</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>How do you know how to use it?</h2>
      <p>Read the documentation like you did for CatAPI</p>
      <p>If it doesn't have good documentation, don't use it</p>

    <!-- DESIGNING YOUR OWN SOFTWARE/PROGRAMS -->
    <article class='slide slide-list'>
      <h2>Designing Programs/Software</h2>
      <p>Start small</p>
      <p>Write pseudo-code to think about the logic before you write code</p>
      <p>Keep your code organized and write lots of comments</p>
    </article>

    <article class='slide slide-list'>
      <h2>Start Small</h2>
      <p>Divide your project into goals</p>
      <p>e.g. 'Posting a blog entry' or 'deleting a blog entry', 'animate some CSS properties', 'fix order calculation problem on my shopping cart'</p>
    </article> 

    <article class='slide slide-list'>
      <h2>Pseudo-Code</h2>
      <pre class='prettyprint'>

        var maxKittenCapacity is 3;
        var kittenCount starts at 0;

        // 
        while kittenCount is less than maxKittenCapacity
          add 1 to kittenCount and maxKittenCapacity
      </pre>
    </article>

    <article class='slide slide-list'>
      <h2>Stay Organized</h2>
      <p>Maintain a consistent style</p>
      <p>Comment liberally! Future you will thank you.</p>
      <p>Functions ~50 lines or less (keeps them easier to debug!)</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Namespaces/Namespacing</h2>
      <p>Use objects to organize your code</p>
      <p>Store functions on an object (methods) to group functions together</p>
      <p>This helps similarly named functions from colliding because of scope</p>
      <p>This is called namespacing, because you are taking some code, naming it, and giving it some space to call it's own</p>
